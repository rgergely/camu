# Camera utilities

This project contains utilities for generating, converting and managing camera poses in Python. It includes a set of functions for easy generation and manipulation of camera poses and trajectories. 

The `camu` module defines the `camera` class with a rich set of initialization and conversion functions.

The `geom` module defines functions for generating 3D poses on a spherical sector or trajectory. It also collects useful coordinate transformations.
